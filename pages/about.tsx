      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Hey, I&apos;m Agustin ‚Äî a Cloud Engineer and SQL Server Admin based in the U.S. I&apos;ve worked across sysadmin, DevOps, and DBA roles, managing complex systems, automating the boring stuff, and always troubleshooting something on fire üî•.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        I started this site to document what I learn, share how I solve problems, and maybe even help someone else avoid the pain I went through. From PowerShell to Terraform, from SQL backups to Linux servers, this is my home base.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        When I&apos;m not in the terminal, I&apos;m hiking, playing tennis or golf, or learning something new (probably security-related).
      </p>
